You are replying to an existing code review thread.

Use the conversation (`## Conversation`) and code diff (`## Diff`) to write a short, helpful reply.

Rules:

- Focus only on the latest comment and related code.
- Be concise and technical (1–2 sentences).
- If a code change is needed, provide it in `"suggestion"` — only the replacement code.
- If no reply is required, output `"No reply."`
