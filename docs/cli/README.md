## 💡 Examples

### 🧠 Full Review

Runs the complete review cycle — inline + summary:

```bash
ai-review run
```

### 🧩 Inline Review Only

For quick line-by-line comments:

```bash
ai-review run-inline
```

Typical in CI/CD pipelines for fast feedback on changed files.

### 🧠 Context Review

For broader architectural or cross-file feedback:

```bash
ai-review run-context
```

The model receives the entire diff set and can highlight inconsistencies between modules.

### 🗒️ Summary Review

Posts one concise summary comment under the merge/pull request:

```bash
ai-review run-summary
```

Useful when inline feedback isn’t required but a global analysis is.

### 💬 Reply Modes

Generate AI-based follow-ups to existing discussion threads:

```bash
ai-review run-inline-reply
ai-review run-summary-reply
```

Replies only to comments originally created by AI Review.

### ⚙️ Inspect Configuration

Display the resolved configuration used by the CLI:

```bash
ai-review show-config
```

Output (formatted JSON):

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "OPENAI",
    "meta": {
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "temperature": 0.3
    }
  },
  "vcs": {
    "provider": "GITLAB",
    "pipeline": {
      "project_id": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚙️ Tips

- Each command runs **asynchronously** and handles exceptions internally.
- All reviews report **token usage** and **LLM cost** after completion.
- The CLI is designed for **non-interactive** use — perfect for CI/CD jobs.
